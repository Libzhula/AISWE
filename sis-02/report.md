# SIS #02 — AI-Assisted UML Modeling: University Course Registration

<!--
  This is the only file you write your report in. README.md tells you what goes where.

  Rules the checker relies on:
  - Do not delete, rename or renumber the ## headings, the ### headings, or the **Label:** words.
  - Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". None may be left when you submit.
  - Comments like this one are ignored by the checker and the word counter. Delete them or leave them.
-->

## 1. Scope and assumptions

<!-- Your FINAL scope statement and assumptions, after reviewing Prompt A's output. Say here
     what is out of scope (payments, prerequisites, timetable clashes, waiting lists,
     cancellation) — section 2 must not mention them. Section 10 keeps your first version. -->

**Scope:** (write here)

**Assumptions:**

1. (write here)
2. (write here)

## 2. User stories and acceptance criteria

<!-- Your APPROVED requirements: Prompt A's draft after your review. Keep the IDs, the three
     story headings and the bullet shape. Every criterion names the rule(s) it maps to,
     e.g. (R2, R4). Two criteria per story. Nothing out of scope.
     Format of a criterion, on one bullet:
     - **AC-03** (R2, R4): Given ..., When ..., Then ... -->

### US-01 — Browse offerings

**US-01:** (write here — As a student, I want …, so that …)

- **AC-01** (R?): (write here — Given …, When …, Then …)
- **AC-02** (R?): (write here)

### US-02 — Register for an offering

**US-02:** (write here)

- **AC-03** (R?): (write here)
- **AC-04** (R?): (write here)

### US-03 — Receive a clear rejection

**US-03:** (write here)

- **AC-05** (R?): (write here)
- **AC-06** (R?): (write here)

## 3. Sequence diagram

<!-- The FINAL diagram, rendered. Change .png to .svg if that is what you exported. -->

![Final sequence diagram](models/img/sequence.png)

**Participants:** (write here — each lifeline and what it stands for)

**Atomic operation:** (write here — which messages form the one atomic step: the final duplicate check, the capacity check and the creation of the Enrollment, and why a catalog view reserves nothing)

**Where the Enrollment is created:** (write here — which message, which lifeline, and which class in section 4 it produces)

**Technical lifelines:** (write here — every lifeline that is NOT a class in the class diagram, by name, and why the difference in abstraction is fine. "None" if there are none.)

## 4. Class diagram

<!-- The FINAL diagram, rendered. -->

![Final class diagram](models/img/classes.png)

<!-- One row per association in classes.puml, read in both directions. -->

| Association | Read left to right | Read right to left |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

**How an Enrollment links a student to an offering:** (write here)

**Capacity constraint:** (write here — and why multiplicity alone cannot express it)

**Uniqueness constraint:** (write here — and why multiplicity alone cannot express it)

## 5. Traceability

<!-- Every rule, including the catalog fields and availability (R1). Column 1: the rule and
     the criteria that cover it, e.g. "R2 + AC-03, AC-04". Column 2: the message, guard,
     class or constraint that shows the rule in YOUR diagrams. Column 3: the T-ID that
     exercises it, or the extra check you did instead (R1 has no T case). -->

| Rule and criterion | Model evidence | Validation case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R2 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R3 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R4 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R5 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

## 6. Walkthroughs

<!-- Walk each case through YOUR final sequence diagram, message by message. Column 2: the
     actual steps and the state change (count before → after). Column 3 starts with Pass or
     Fail, then the location: the message, guard or note where you saw it. A Fail you
     report honestly is a finding, not a penalty. -->

| Case | Observed path and state change | Judgment and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1. Available | (write here) | (write here) |
| T2. Last place | (write here) | (write here) |
| T3. Full | (write here) | (write here) |
| T4. Duplicate | (write here) | (write here) |

## 7. Review decisions

<!-- At least three substantive decisions about Prompt C's critique or your own inspection.
     Decision: accepted / rejected / modified — and what you did. Reason: why, in a full
     sentence. Rule: R1–R5. Do not invent an error to fill the table; a justified rejection
     of advice counts. -->

| AI suggestion or model element | Decision | Reason | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

## 8. Modeling explanation

<!-- 200–300 words. Your main design choices; how the class diagram and the sequence diagram
     complement each other; why an activity diagram could also help explain the workflow. -->

(write here)

## 9. Reflection

<!-- 150–200 words. Written by you, not by the assistant: where AI helped, one decision you
     made yourself, one remaining limitation. Specific beats flattering. -->

(write here)

## 10. Appendix A — Before AI

<!-- Written BEFORE you run Prompt A, committed and pushed in your first commit, and never
     edited afterwards. This is what you paste into Prompt A as "My initial assumptions". -->

**Scope:** Model course catalog browsing and registration for one student choosing one existing course offering in one semester.

**Initial assumptions:**

1. Catalog browsing only displays availability and never reserves a seat.
2. Registration is atomic, so duplicate and capacity checks happen immediately before enrollment creation.

## 11. Appendix B — AI exchanges

<!-- Complete prompts and complete responses, as text — never screenshots. Paste each inside
     the ~~~~ block that follows its label: AI responses contain ``` PlantUML blocks, and
     ~~~~ keeps them from breaking this file. Prompts B and C: the prompt text first, then
     the material it refers to ("below", "these two") pasted under it, in the same block.
     You may add B5, B6 … after B4 if you ran more. -->

## 13. Appendix D — References and source checks

### References

<!-- Full references, one per line, each starting with "- ". Only sources you actually opened.
     Every URL used in the source checks must also appear here. Example:
     - Sommerville, I. (2016). Software Engineering, 10th ed., Global Edition. Pearson. Ch. 5. -->

- (write here)

### Source checks

<!-- At least two modeling decisions you verified. Source and locator: title + slide, page,
     section, chapter or figure — or title + URL + access date (YYYY-MM-DD). Slide numbers
     refer to the decks posted in our Teams. -->

| Modeling decision | Source and locator | What the source says | How it supports or changed your model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
